                <P>Tourism is an important factor worldwide that allows for a sharing of culture and money. We
                    want to encourage our users to go out into the world and find new and exciting places. However
                    many people struggle to find such places to travel to and so end up not traveling. Our solution
                    should be to provide a way for users to find places to vacation to.
